/**
 * Trust-anchor assembly for the TUI's verify path — the terminal twin of the CLI's
 * repeatable `--trust-anchor=<root.pem>` (shells/cli/src/validate.ts).
 *
 * Why this file exists: the TUI verifies bytes with the SAME engine verifier the CLI and
 * the web /valid view run, but it has no argv to carry pinned CA roots. Without a source
 * for them the identical file verified as "Verified" in the CLI (`--trust-anchor=corp.pem`)
 * read plain untrusted here — a confidently wrong verdict in a trust tool. Anchors are
 * therefore sourced from the two places a long-lived interactive shell can read:
 *
 *   1. `LOLLY_TRUST_ANCHOR` — a PATH-style list (path.delimiter separated) of PEM files.
 *   2. `trustAnchors` on the persisted profile record (~/.lolly/profile.json, store.ts),
 *      editable from the Profile view. A string (same PATH-style list) or an array.
 *
 * Env wins the ordering (it is the more explicit, per-invocation channel) but both are
 * pinned; the two lists are concatenated and de-duplicated.
 *
 * Policy note, deliberately identical to the CLI: the Lolly CA root is NOT pinned
 * (includeLollyRoot: false), so a Lolly-CA-signed export that reads "Verified" on the web
 * /valid view reads plain "Credential intact" in the terminal unless its root is pinned
 * here. That split is the documented one in engine/src/c2pa-verdict.ts.
 *
 * Pure enough to test: only `loadTrustAnchors` touches disk, and every string it renders
 * comes from `describeAnchors`, which is a pure function of the resolved sources.
